## Overview and Origin

* Company name Goldman Sachs

* Founded 1869

* Marcus Goldman, Samuel Sachs

* I was interested in doing a case study on a large company that has been semi-resistant to adopting cryptocurrency into their business plan.

* Was originally funded by Marcus Goldman, unable to locate initial  investment


## Business Activities:

* Banking and investments

* The bank tended to be focused on large companies or extremely high net worth individuals. With their new Marcus product, they are opening the door to lower income individuals to use their services.

* The company uses a wide variety of technologies to meet their end goals. They use technology such as data analytics/big data to analyze the financial markets to determine the best investment opportunities. They have recently started looking at using digital assets such as blockchains to help with various problems like payments and remitments and also as a possible investment opportunity.


## Landscape:

* Various, huge into investment banking

* As this company has various domains, they have had various impacts. One example, the company has used technology to enhance their robo advising and have even opened up their investment opportunities to lower income people via their Marcus product. Thereby allowing a greater percentage of the population investment opportunities. 

* JPMorgan Chase, BofA Securities, Morgan Stanley.


## Results

* The impact this company has on the world is huge. They manage billions of dollars in investments.

* Annual rate of return is one of the more commonly used metrics. Goldmanâ€™s returns are generally above average.

* The company is performing above average.


## Recommendations

* I would suggest the company really dig even deeper into cryptocurrency and other digital assets. While they have started to look into it as they have been very hesitant to embrace it. There are so many products that could be offered here. 

* These types of services are relatively new, and a lot of companies charge a premium for services like this. Coinbase for example, a large cryptocurrency exchange, charges a large premium on trades. There is money to be made here with having more competitors in the space.

* Digital assets, blockchain tech

* These technologies are the solutions.
